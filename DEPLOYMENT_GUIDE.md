# Archivemind Discord Bot - Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes & Enhancements

### üîß Database Issues Resolved
- **Fixed pgvector dependency**: Removed pgvector extension from Prisma schema (not supported in Prisma Accelerate)
- **Database migration**: Successfully reset and created new migration without pgvector
- **Text search implementation**: Added proper text search indexes for content discovery
- **Database verification**: Confirmed connectivity and data integrity

### üöÄ Enhanced Real-time Resource Extraction
- **Automatic detection**: Bot now automatically detects and extracts valuable content from messages
- **Improved detection logic**: Enhanced `hasValuableContent()` to consider attachments
- **Real-time processing**: Messages are processed as they arrive in watched channels
- **Manual extraction**: New `/extract-resources` command for retroactive resource extraction

### üõ†Ô∏è Code Quality
- **TypeScript compilation**: All compilation errors resolved ‚úÖ
- **Test coverage**: All 16 tests passing ‚úÖ
- **Code structure**: Clean, maintainable codebase with proper error handling

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify `.env` file contains all required variables:
  - `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
  - `DATABASE_URL` - Prisma Accelerate connection string
  - `PULSE_API_KEY` - Prisma Pulse API key (if using real-time features)

### Database Verification
- [ ] Run database check: `node scripts/check-db.js`
- [ ] Ensure database is accessible and properly migrated

### Build & Test
- [ ] Run build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Both should complete without errors

### Discord Bot Setup
- [ ] Verify bot has proper permissions in Discord Developer Portal:
  - Read Messages
  - Send Messages
  - Use Slash Commands
  - Manage Channels (for archiving)
  - Read Message History
- [ ] Bot is invited to your Discord server with appropriate permissions

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Start the Bot
```bash
npm start
```

### 2. Verify Bot Status
- Check console output for successful login
- Verify slash commands are registered
- Test `/help` command in Discord

### 3. Set Up Monitoring
- Watch for resource extraction activity
- Monitor database for new resources
- Check console logs for any errors

### 4. Test New Features

#### Test Real-time Resource Extraction:
1. Send a message with valuable content in a watched channel:
   ```
   Check out this awesome GitHub repo: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode
   ```
2. Verify the bot detects and extracts the resource
3. Use `/find` command to search for the extracted resource

#### Test Manual Resource Extraction:
1. Use the new `/extract-resources` command:
   ```
   /extract-resources count:50
   ```
2. Verify resources are extracted from recent messages
3. Check database for new resources

## üîç Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Check Database Contents
```bash
node scripts/check-db.js
```

### Common Issues
- **No resources found**: Normal if no valuable content has been posted yet
- **Search returns empty**: Database might be empty - try posting valuable content first
- **Bot not responding**: Check console for errors and verify environment variables

### Logs to Monitor
- Resource extraction activity
- Database connection status
- Command execution results
- Error messages

## üìä Current Database State
- **Watched Channels**: 1 (ready for monitoring)
- **Archived Channels**: 0 (none archived yet)
- **Resources**: 0 (will populate as valuable content is detected)

## üéØ Next Steps After Deployment
1. **Post valuable content** in watched channels to test real-time extraction
2. **Use `/extract-resources`** to process historical messages
3. **Monitor resource accumulation** with `/stats` command
4. **Test search functionality** with `/find` command once resources exist

## üèÜ Success Criteria
- [ ] Bot successfully starts and connects to Discord
- [ ] Real-time resource extraction works on new messages
- [ ] Manual `/extract-resources` command functions properly
- [ ] Database populates with extracted resources
- [ ] Search functionality returns relevant results
- [ ] All existing commands continue to work properly

---

**Note**: The bot is now fully functional and ready for deployment. The database is clean and properly migrated, and all enhanced features are implemented and tested.
